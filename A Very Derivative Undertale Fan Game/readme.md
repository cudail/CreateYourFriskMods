In 2017 I entered a contest on /r/Unitale to create an Undertale battle with the
worst possible control scheme. I won. Learn some maths with A Very Derivative
Undertale Fan Game, a mod for [Create Your Frisk].

To play copy the mod files into the latest [Create Your Frisk] release and
select it from the mod selection screen.

The menus control like in Undertale: Arrow keys, Z and X. In battle use your
mouse to control the sliders.
